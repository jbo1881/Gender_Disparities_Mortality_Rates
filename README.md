# Gender_Disparities_Mortality_Rates

## Description

Exploring Gender Disparities in Mortality Rates: Shocking Revelations in Decade-by-Decade Breakdown.

### Data Retrieval and Preprocessing

The project uses Python to analyze mortality rates among genders using Spanish data retrieved from INE mortality tables (2003-2022). The data is preprocessed to extract age and mortality values for both men and women.

### Visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is employed to visualize the mortality rates, highlighting the disparities between men and women across different age groups. The analysis includes animations depicting the evolution of mortality rates over the years.

### Technologies Used

The project leverages Python for data analysis and visualization, specifically utilizing Matplotlib for plotting graphs and animations.

## File Structure

The repository consists of the following files and directories:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and technologies used.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **main.py**: Contains the main Python script responsible for data retrieval, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **stats.py**: Includes additional Python code for calculating average mortality rates and analyzing differences between genders.
- **tdmort.txt**: Data file containing mortality statistics from Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Python script `main.py` to analyze mortality rates and generate visualizations.
4. View the generated outputs, including plots and animations.

**Additional Analysis Insights:**

The study uncovers significant differences in mortality rates between genders, with women generally exhibiting lower risks compared to men. Mortality risk escalates with age, with each decade showing a notable increase compared to the previous one.

Ages 70-79 and 80-89 emerge as critical decades, showcasing substantial disparities in mortality risk between men and women. Notably, at age 93, the difference peaks at 37.094 deaths per thousand.

Natural selection predicts more male deaths, adjusting birth rates to balance gender ratios over time: on average, for every hundred girls born, five hundred boys are born.
